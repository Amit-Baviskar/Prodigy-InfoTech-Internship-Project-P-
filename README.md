Welcome to my Data Science Projects repository! This repository contains a collection of data analysis and machine learning tasks that demonstrate my skills in data visualization, exploratory data analysis (EDA), machine learning, and sentiment analysis.

Each task is accompanied by well-documented code, visualizations, and insights to make it easy to understand and reproduce. Below is an overview of the tasks included in this repository:

> # **Task 1: Visualizing Distribution with Bar Charts and Histograms**


### **Objective**
  
To create a bar chart or histogram that visualizes the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as age or gender, in a given dataset.

### **Key Highlights**
  
* Implemented data visualization techniques using libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn.
* Created clear and informative bar charts and histograms to represent data distributions.
* Gained insights into the structure of the dataset by observing distribution patterns.

### **Deliverables**

* Python script for data visualization.
* Example visualizations (bar chart, histogram) with accompanying explanations.

> # **Task 2: Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**


### **Objective**

To clean and analyze a dataset (e.g., the Titanic dataset from Kaggle) to uncover relationships between variables and identify meaningful patterns and trends.

###  **Key Highlights**

* Performed data cleaning, including handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistent entries.
* Conducted EDA to explore variable relationships using summary statistics and visualizations.
* Explored key questions like survival rates by gender and class using the Titanic dataset.

###  **Deliverables**

* Python script for data cleaning and EDA.
* Interactive visualizations showing trends and relationships in the data.
* Insights and conclusions documented in markdown or a notebook.
 
> # **Task 3: Decision Tree Classifier for Customer Purchase Prediction**

### **Objective**

To build a decision tree classifier that predicts whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data using the Bank Marketing dataset.

###  **Key Highlights**

* Preprocessed the dataset to handle missing values and encode categorical variables.
* Built and fine-tuned a decision tree classifier using Scikit-learn.
* Evaluated the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
* Visualized the decision tree structure for interoperability.

###  **Deliverables**

* Python script for building and evaluating the decision tree model.
* Model performance metrics and confusion matrix visualizations.
* Insights into factors influencing customer purchase decisions.

> # **Task 4: Sentiment Analysis and Visualization of Social Media Data**

### **Objective**
To analyze and visualize sentiment patterns in social media data, identifying public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or brands.

###  **Key Highlights**

* Collected and preprocessed social media data (e.g., Twitter, Reddit).
* Performed sentiment analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
* Visualized sentiment trends using time-series plots, word clouds, and bar charts.
* Extracted actionable insights regarding public opinion.

###  **Deliverables**

* Python script for sentiment analysis and visualization.
* Visualizations such as sentiment trends, topic distributions, and word clouds.
* Insights into public sentiment and its implications.
